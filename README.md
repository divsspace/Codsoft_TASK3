#TASK3

This project was undertaken for an internship under CODSOFT, requiring the completion of 3 tasks based on Java Programming.

This is an ATM Interface that performs the following transactions based on user input- 1) Deposit 2) Withdrawal 3) Check Balance 4) Exit.

Each choice comes with appropriate display messages and limits(eg- Cannot withdraw money higher than the balance). The balance is updated per the performed transactions.
